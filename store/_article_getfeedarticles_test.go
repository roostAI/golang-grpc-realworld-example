FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *ArticleStore) GetFeedArticles(userIDs []uint, limit, offset int64) ([]model.Article, error) 
```markdown
Scenario 1: User has multiple articles, and all should be retrieved

Details:
  Description: This test checks that the GetFeedArticles function correctly retrieves all articles written by users in the provided user IDs list. The focus is to evaluate if articles are fetched and associated with their respective author.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a database seeded with multiple articles by a specific user. Include the user ID in the list of user IDs.
    Act: Call GetFeedArticles with the user IDs list containing that specific user, a limit that exceeds the available articles, and zero offset.
    Assert: Verify that all articles by the user are included in the returned slice and each article has the author preloaded.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Confirming retrieval of all matching articles validates correct functioning of query assembly with user ID filtering.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures that users receive a complete feed of articles they've subscribed to based on author, maintaining the integrity of social or subscription features of the application.

Scenario 2: Limit the number of articles returned

Details:
  Description: The test aims to verify if limiting the number of articles returned works as expected, examining whether the limit parameter in GetFeedArticles is correctly applied.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Add several articles authored by multiple users to the database. The user IDs list includes these users.
    Act: Invoke GetFeedArticles with a set user IDs list, a limit less than the available articles, and zero offset.
    Assert: Check that the number of articles returned does not exceed the specified limit.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Limiting article retrieval is essential for pagination, ensuring efficient load times and manageable data chunks.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: It supports application scalability, user experience consistency, and server-side request handling efficiency by enforcing pagination limits.

Scenario 3: Offset functionality should skip the specified number of articles

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the GetFeedArticles function properly handles the offset parameter, ensuring that it skips the designated number of articles before returning results.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Insert a sequence of articles with identifiable order into the database, authored by the same user.
    Act: Call GetFeedArticles with that user ID, a reasonable limit, and an offset equal to a partial subset of the articles.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned articles start after the specified offset, containing the subsequent articles.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Validating offset functionality confirms the ability to navigate extensive result sets efficiently.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: It is crucial for implementing pagination in user interfaces, allowing subsequent access to portions of a potentially large data set.

Scenario 4: Handle cases with no matching user IDs

Details:
  Description: Check how GetFeedArticles behaves when the function receives a list of user IDs that do not correlate with any articles in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure the database contains articles only from a different set of users than those provided.
    Act: Execute GetFeedArticles with a non-matching list of user IDs, a limit, and an offset.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns an empty list of articles and no errors.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assuring the correctness of result when no records match is critical to avoiding misleading data presentations.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Establishes baseline behavior when filtering criteria exclude any records, reinforcing trust that subscription queries do not produce spurious results.

Scenario 5: Function gracefully handles a database error

Details:
  Description: This test scenario evaluates the functionâ€™s robustness and error handling when the underlying database operation fails.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Simulate a database error (e.g., connection failure or SQL execution error) using a mocking tool.
    Act: Invoke GetFeedArticles under these error conditions.
    Assert: Validate that the error returned is not nil and matches the mocked database error.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Proper error propagation is necessary for maintaining reliable error diagnostics and recovery in calling functions.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Reliable error communication is vital for debugging, monitoring, and implementing fallback mechanisms within applications.
