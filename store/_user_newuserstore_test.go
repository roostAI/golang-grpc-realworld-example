FUNCTION_DEF=func NewUserStore(db *gorm.DB) *UserStore 
```
Scenario 1: Initialization of UserStore with a Valid DB Handle

Details:
  Description: This test aims to verify that a new UserStore is correctly initialized with a valid gorm.DB handle. It checks whether the UserStore's db field is set to the passed gorm.DB instance.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock or a real instance of gorm.DB to simulate a database connection.
    Act: Call NewUserStore() with the gorm.DB instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned UserStore's db field equals the provided gorm.DB instance.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assert checks if the internal state of UserStore reflects the input db, ensuring the constructor performs its role of storing the passed DB.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures that operations using UserStore can interact with the DB correctly, as having an incorrect DB handle would break all storage operations.

Scenario 2: Initialization of UserStore with a Nil DB Handle

Details:
  Description: This test examines the behavior of NewUserStore when passed a nil DB handle, which is an edge case.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use a nil value for gorm.DB.
    Act: Invoke NewUserStore() with nil.
    Assert: Confirm whether the behavior is as expected (e.g., UserStore allows nil db or needs error handling).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assert checks how the function handles nil input, whether by design the db can be nil or if explicit error handling is required.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures robust handling of edge cases that could lead to nil pointer dereferences, critical for application stability.

Scenario 3: UserStore Struct Fields Correctness

Details:
  Description: Test the integrity and unchanged state of the UserStore struct fields beyond initialization.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a valid gorm.DB instance and create a new UserStore.
    Act: Use reflection to check the fields of the UserStore.
    Assert: Ensure all fields of UserStore, particularly the db, are present and correctly typed.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Establishes that UserStore fields retain their expected structure, vital for compile-time and runtime consistency.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Integrity of data structures ensures correct operation of methods that rely on UserStore's fields.

Scenario 4: Proper Invocation with Mocked Dependencies

Details:
  Description: This test checks if NewUserStore correctly invokes internal mechanisms by using a mock gorm.DB to simulate database logic.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock gorm.DB with controlled behavior responding to expected interface methods.
    Act: Pass the mock to NewUserStore() and invoke simple operations on the UserStore.
    Assert: Use mock expectations to verify interactions through the db field.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The mock interactions ensure that gorm.DB methods are correctly set and can be called by the UserStore using dependency inversion.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Confirms that NewUserStore accommodates extensions for testing or diverse database backends, crucial for scalability and testing reliability.
```

These scenarios comprehensively cover the initialization and basic interactions with the `UserStore`, ensuring stability, performance, and correctness in routine and edge cases.
