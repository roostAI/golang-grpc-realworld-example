FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *UserStore) GetByEmail(email string) (*model.User, error) 
```plaintext
Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of a user by email

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that `GetByEmail` successfully retrieves a user record when a valid email that exists in the database is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the database contains a user with a specific email address.
  Act: Call `GetByEmail` with the email address of the user in the database.
  Assert: Check the returned user matches the data stored in the database.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Verifying that the returned user data matches expected values ensures that the query is executed properly and the mapping of database result to User struct is correct.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This function is critical for operations like authentication and profile management where identifying users by email is central.

Scenario 2: Email not found in database

Details:
  Description: This test examines the behavior of `GetByEmail` when the provided email address does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure no user exists with the given email address in the database.
  Act: Call `GetByEmail` with an email address that is not in the database.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns `nil` and an error.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Ensures function correctly handles cases where the email is not found by returning an appropriate error, thus failing gracefully.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This scenario is critical for ensuring robustness against user input errors or potential database integrity issues.

Scenario 3: Database connection fails

Details:
  Description: This test assesses how `GetByEmail` reacts when there is a failure in connecting to the database, perhaps due to connection timeout or misconfiguration.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database connection to simulate a connection failure.
  Act: Call `GetByEmail` with any email.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an error indicating the connection failure.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Detecting database connection issues prevents runtime errors from leaking into the application layer, allowing graceful error handling.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures reliability and stability, alerting us to operational problems before they impact users significantly.

Scenario 4: Case sensitivity in email retrieval

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether `GetByEmail` treats email addresses as case-sensitive when attempting to retrieve a user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Store a user with a known email in mixed-case format.
  Act: Call `GetByEmail` with the email address in different case variations.
  Assert: Based on database configuration, assert if the function correctly identifies the user or fails.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: It's crucial to ensure consistent email handling in both storage and retrieval, depending on business requirements for case sensitivity.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Misalignment in expectations might result in account access issues or duplicate entries, affecting user experience and data integrity.

Scenario 5: Querying with SQL injection attempt

Details:
  Description: Validate that `GetByEmail` safely queries the database without risk of SQL injection by improper sanitization of input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass an email string formatted to mimic typical SQL injection patterns.
  Act: Call `GetByEmail` with a potentially harmful input.
  Assert: Ensure that the query execution does not alter the database and results in an error or safe failure.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Protects the database from unauthorized access or data compromise by testing query safety.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Protecting against SQL injection ensures the security and integrity of the system, protecting sensitive user data.
