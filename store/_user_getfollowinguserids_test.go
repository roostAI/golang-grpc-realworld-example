FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *UserStore) GetFollowingUserIDs(m *model.User) ([]uint, error) 
Scenario 1: Retrieve Following User IDs Successfully

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality where a user with existing follow relationships retrieves the correct list of IDs of the users they are following.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user who follows several other users. Ensure the "follows" table contains records reflecting these relationships.
  Act: Invoke the `GetFollowingUserIDs` function with the user model of the follower.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a slice containing the correct IDs of users being followed.

Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion ensures that every followed user's ID is returned and that no extra or missing IDs exist, verifying correct query execution and result processing.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Correct retrieval of followed user IDs is crucial for features that require displaying or interacting with a list of followed users, such as social networking functionalities.

---

Scenario 2: No Followers for User

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior when a user has no follow relations, testing if the function correctly returns an empty list without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database containing a user who doesn't follow any other users.
  Act: Call the `GetFollowingUserIDs` function with the model of the non-following user.
  Assert: Confirm the function returns an empty slice, indicating the user follows no one.

Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Returning an empty slice correctly reflects the absence of follow relationships, ensuring the function handles cases without follow records.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: The ability to handle cases where users follow no one is essential for robust user profile management and accurate data representation.

---

Scenario 3: Handling Database Connection Error

Details:
  Description: This scenario assesses the function's response when a database connection error occurs, ensuring error propagation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate a scenario where the database connection is faulty or unavailable, such as by configuring the mock DB to return a connection error.
  Act: Invoke the `GetFollowingUserIDs` function under these conditions.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an error, specifically reflecting the connection issue.

Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks that errors are not swallowed or misrepresented, which is vital for debugging and system stability.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Proper error handling is crucial to maintain application resilience, informing users/admins of underlying issues.

---

Scenario 4: Handling SQL Query Execution Error

Details:
  Description: Examine the function's behavior when an SQL execution error occurs, ensuring it appropriately returns an error without unintended side effects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a faulty SQL statement execution simulation within the mock database setup, such as by altering query permissions or table states.
  Act: Call the `GetFollowingUserIDs` function in this erroneous environment.
  Assert: Confirm that an error is returned, indicating a problem with SQL execution.

Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Ensuring errors are returned helps in diagnosing issues during query execution, supporting effective debugging and maintenance.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Accurate error reporting helps maintain system integrity and supports quick resolution of unexpected issues in real-time applications.

---

Scenario 5: Invalid User Input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies how the function behaves when an invalid user object (e.g., with a non-existing ID) is passed in, ensuring input validation or error handling occurs gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a user model instance that is not present in the "follows" table or the user database in general.
  Act: Use this non-existing user instance to call the `GetFollowingUserIDs` function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns an empty list or an appropriate error indicating invalid input.

Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Handling invalid inputs without causing application failures is crucial for robust application logic.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Validating inputs prevents unexpected behavior and potential crashes, ensuring continued application reliability.
