FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *ArticleStore) GetCommentByID(id uint) (*model.Comment, error)
### Scenario 1: Successfully Retrieve an Existing Comment by ID

Details:
- Description: This test checks the primary functionality of `GetCommentByID`, ensuring it can correctly retrieve a comment from the database when provided with a valid ID that exists.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Create a mock `gorm.DB` instance and set it up with a known comment. Ensure the mock returns the expected comment when queried with the given ID.
  - Act: Invoke `GetCommentByID` with the correct ID that matches the mock data.
  - Assert: Verify that the returned comment is the same as the one in the mock database.
- Validation:
  - Explains that this test is crucial to confirm that the function retrieves data as expected. Successful retrieval is fundamental to application operations involving user interaction with comments.

### Scenario 2: Attempt to Retrieve a Non-Existent Comment by ID

Details:
- Description: This test aims to verify the function's behavior when attempting to fetch a comment that doesn't exist in the database.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Set up a mock `gorm.DB` instance, ensuring that it returns an error indicating no result when queried with a non-existing ID.
  - Act: Call `GetCommentByID` with a non-existent ID.
  - Assert: Check that the function returns a `nil` comment and an appropriate error indicating that the entity was not found.
- Validation:
  - Ensures the function correctly handles scenarios where comments are not found, which is important for robust error handling and user feedback.

### Scenario 3: Attempt to Retrieve a Comment with an Invalid Database Connection

Details:
- Description: This test checks the function's behavior when there is a problem with the database connection such as a connection failure or query execution error.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Configure a mock `gorm.DB` instance to simulate a database error, for example by returning a connection error.
  - Act: Attempt to retrieve a comment using `GetCommentByID` with any ID.
  - Assert: Verify that the function returns an error related to the database issue and a `nil` comment pointer.
- Validation:
  - Tests the application's resilience to database connectivity issues, ensuring that it gracefully handles and reports such errors instead of crashing.

### Scenario 4: Retrieve a Comment with Valid ID and Verify Associated Fields

Details:
- Description: This test examines whether `GetCommentByID` correctly populates all relevant fields of the `Comment` model for a successful retrieval.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Create a mock `gorm.DB` instance and populate it with a comment having associated `User` and `Article` objects. Set this mock comment to be returned when queried by its ID.
  - Act: Call `GetCommentByID` with the ID of the mock comment.
  - Assert: Verify that all fields of the `Comment`, including related fields (`User`, `Article`), are populated accurately.
- Validation:
  - Ensures comprehensive data retrieval and integrity, serving as a check for proper struct hydration, which is necessary for functionalities relying on complete comment data.

### Scenario 5: Concurrent Access to Retrieve Comments

Details:
- Description: This test evaluates how `GetCommentByID` performs under concurrent access scenarios, such as simultaneous requests for different comment IDs.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Set up a mock `gorm.DB` and prepare multiple comments for querying. Use goroutines to simulate concurrent access.
  - Act: Simultaneously request different comments using `GetCommentByID` in multiple goroutines.
  - Assert: Verify all goroutines return the expected comments without data race or corruption.
- Validation:
  - Critical for testing application concurrency support, ensuring that concurrent data access doesn't lead to inconsistencies or performance bottlenecks.

By covering these scenarios, the tests ensure that the `GetCommentByID` function behaves reliably under various conditions, providing confidence in the correctness and robustness of the function's implementation.
