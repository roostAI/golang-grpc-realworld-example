FUNCTION_DEF=func (c *Comment) ProtoComment() *pb.Comment 
Scenario 1: Conversion of Basic Comment to ProtoComment

Details:
  Description: Validates that a basic Comment with typical values is correctly converted into its protobuf representation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Comment instance with populated ID, Body, CreatedAt, and UpdatedAt fields.
  Act: Call the ProtoComment method on the Comment instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned pb.Comment has the correct id, body, createdAt, and updatedAt fields.
Validation:
  Explain: The test ensures that typical data fields are converted accurately, representing normal usage.
  Discuss: This scenario is fundamental as it directly checks the correctness of basic functionality necessary for communication with gRPC clients.

Scenario 2: Conversion with Empty Body

Details:
  Description: Tests how the function handles the conversion of a Comment with an empty body string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Comment with an empty string for the Body field.
  Act: Invoke ProtoComment on this Comment instance.
  Assert: Verify that the pb.Comment's Body field is an empty string.
Validation:
  Explain: The assertion ensures that an empty body is handled correctly without errors or missing fields.
  Discuss: Important for ensuring edge cases in user-generated content are managed without failures, maintaining system robustness.

Scenario 3: Conversion of Comment with Future Timestamps

Details:
  Description: Assesses the functionality when the CreatedAt and UpdatedAt timestamps are set in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Comment with future dates for CreatedAt and UpdatedAt.
  Act: Use the ProtoComment method.
  Assert: Ensure that the pb.Comment's createdAt and updatedAt fields reflect the future timestamps formatted as ISO8601 strings.
Validation:
  Explain: The usage of future dates helps confirm the function handles any valid timestamp without error or truncation.
  Discuss: Ensures that temporal data from various sources or scenarios is reliably processed, critical for applications that may operate in different time zones.

Scenario 4: Conversion of Comment with Null Author

Details:
  Description: Checks if function correctly processes a Comment without an associated Author.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Comment without setting the Author field.
  Act: Invoke ProtoComment.
  Assert: Verify that the returned pb.Comment's Author profile is nil.
Validation:
  Explain: The test ensures proper handling when optional or nullable fields aren't populated.
  Discuss: Important for scenarios where authorship information might be decoupled or removed, common in some business models.

Scenario 5: Large ID Conversion

Details:
  Description: Tests behavior with large numeric values for Comment ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a Comment with a very large value for ID.
  Act: Call ProtoComment.
  Assert: Check that the pb.Comment's ID string accurately represents the numeric value without overflow.
Validation:
  Explain: Ensures that large integer values are converted to strings without data loss.
  Discuss: Crucial for applications handling large datasets and IDs that could exceed certain thresholds.

Scenario 6: Verify ISO8601 Format

Details:
  Description: Ensures that date fields in the pb.Comment are correctly formatted as ISO8601 strings.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Comment with known timestamp values.
  Act: Retrieve the ProtoComment from the Comment.
  Assert: Validate the createdAt and updatedAt strings using regex or explicit format match against ISO8601.
Validation:
  Explain: Confirming the format aligns with expected standards is crucial for interoperability in applications consuming the proto comments.
  Discuss: Validates compliance with industry standards, essential for integration with third-party systems or APIs.

Scenario 7: Minimal Comment Initialization

Details:
  Description: Evaluates function response when Comment fields are set to minimal defaults or zero values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct a Comment with only default initialization.
  Act: Execute ProtoComment.
  Assert: Ensure pb.Comment returns has defaults or zero values, matching input.
Validation:
  Explain: Tests robustness against minimal initial data input.
  Discuss: Verifies that all Comments, regardless of state, return consistent proto objects, preventing potential application errors.
