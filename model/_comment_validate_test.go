FUNCTION_DEF=func (c Comment) Validate() error 
```
Scenario 1: Validate Comment with Non-Empty Body

Details:
  Description: This test checks that a Comment instance with a non-empty body passes validation successfully.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid Comment instance with the Body field populated with a non-empty string.
    Act: Call the Validate function on the Comment instance.
    Assert: Verify that the Validate function returns nil indicating no validation errors.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: We expect nil because the Body field meets the `Required` constraint (it is non-empty).
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures normal operation where valid comments are allowed without errors, which is critical for functionality.

Scenario 2: Validate Comment with Empty Body

Details:
  Description: This test checks that a Comment instance with an empty body results in a validation error.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Comment instance with the Body field set to an empty string.
    Act: Call the Validate function on the Comment instance.
    Assert: Verify that the Validate function returns an error indicating the body field is required.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The expected result is an error because the Body field does not meet the `Required` constraint.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Validates that the validation logic properly enforces required fields, a basic principle of data integrity.

Scenario 3: Validate Comment with Whitespace-Only Body

Details:
  Description: This test checks that a Comment instance whose body consists only of whitespaces results in a validation error, as whitespaces should be considered equivalent to empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Comment instance with the Body field containing only space characters.
    Act: Call the Validate function on the Comment instance.
    Assert: Verify that the Validate function returns an error indicating the body field is required despite whitespace presence.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Expecting a validation error because spaces, while characters, do not constitute a valid text input against the `Required` constraint.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Helps ensure that data stored is meaningful, maintaining strict application data requirements.

Scenario 4: Validate Comment with Very Long Body

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Comment instance passes validation when the Body has a very large input (assuming there's no other restriction beyond required).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Comment instance with the Body field containing a very long string of characters.
    Act: Call the Validate function on the Comment instance.
    Assert: Verify that the Validate function returns nil, indicating the presence of content satisfies validation.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Since the function only checks for non-empty properties, length should not affect result; expecting nil shows that no extra restrictions apply.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Confirms that handling and storage limitations, if not strategic, don't unnecessarily fail under large data volumes.

Scenario 5: Validate Uninitialized Comment Struct

Details:
  Description: This test ensures the validation function behaves correctly when called on an uninitialized (zero-value) Comment struct.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Comment instance without explicitly setting any fields (zero values by default).
    Act: Call the Validate function on the uninitialized Comment instance.
    Assert: Verify that the Validate function returns an error indicating that the body field is required.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Expecting an error because the default Body value is an empty string, which violates the `Required` rule.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Verifies robustness and behavior in cases where defaults may not meet data integrity conditions.
